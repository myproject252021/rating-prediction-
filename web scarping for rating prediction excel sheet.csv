Best laptop for coders. Only cons that i have noticed as of now is its battery backup, on 1 full charge it max to max gives 3 to 4 hours of backup which i think should have been taken care of.",4
1717,Wonderful,"The very handy laptop, it is very light and easy to carry. I'll suggest this laptop for the very basic gaming. The battery is disappointed but the Ryzen 5 is a great processor with 39W battery so here you can't expect a good battery life, I'm using it since 8 days & it's great product and here is no MS office.

If your budget is 45k or less than, so I'll suggest go for this one.",4
1718,Fabulous! Good job by MSI,"Firstly, I was little hesitant whether to invest my hard earned money on a brand MSI which is not so popular in India, as compared to DELL, HP, Lenovo etc. But my decision to go with it is truly amazing with a great product by MSI. Overall a good experience with MSI.

You can play cyberpunk with ray tracing on if u are willing to compromise some fps. At 86k its more than worth it. Still its a good idea to undervolt the cpu and gpu temp because it can get seriously high (like 91¬∞-93¬∞).,4

By replacing ram with 1x8 you can expect 25fps more in eSports title and 10 15fps in AAA title depending on game and by using external monitor you can expect 5 -8% boost .Rest all is great for the price.

RTX 3060 is a MaxQ design, and it needs to be shown in the title. But do not worry, it might be a big low performer compared to non-MaxQ, but it is still faster than the RTX 2060 desktop version.

Processor boosts to 4.3GHz, with a huge temperature, to avoid this, I would suggest you clock down and adjust the voltages.

GPU does not break a sweat, and most of the time it is bottlenecked by the processor.

2561,Must buy!,"Cheapest RTX 3060 Laptop

The laptop gives decent performance in the current AAA titles at high to ultra settings, but sub-par performance in RTX enabled games.
GPU is handicapped due to low TDP of 75 watts. But still better than 1660Ti or high powered 3050 Ti.
CPU by nature tends to run hotter compared to current gen Ryzen CPUs, but undervolting can solve the problem to some extent at the expense of some performance.

Overall a decent package for the money.",5

2595,Really Nice,Apart from the thermals the laptop is pretty good. It can run pretty much every game at ultra or high settings. You can play cyberpunk with ray tracing on if u are willing to compromise some fps. At 86k its more than worth it. Still its a good idea to undervolt the cpu and gpu temp because it can get seriously high (like 91¬∞-93¬∞).,4
2596,Good choice,"Great laptop for gaming just keep in mind it has i5 10500h whose temp goes to 92¬∞c . Also rtx 3060 has maximum tgp of 75w. And main drwaback is ram it has 16gb ram in dual channel but it is 1x16 not 1x8 which bottlenecks cpu but 10-15%. By replacing ram with 1x8 you can expect 25fps more in eSports title and 10 15fps in AAA title depending on game and by using external monitor you can expect 5 -8% boost .Rest all is great for the price.

2597,Best in this category.,"This is one heck of a beast. Throw anything at it, it can handle with ease.

RTX 3060 is a MaxQ design, and it needs to be shown in the title. But do not worry, it might be a big low performer compared to non-MaxQ, but it is still faster than the RTX 2060 desktop version.

Processor boosts to 4.3GHz, with a huge temperature, to avoid this, I would suggest you clock down and adjust the voltages.

GPU does not break a sweat, and most of the time it is bottlenecked by the processor.

Takes a while to gets hands on but I am loving it day by day thanks flipkart or this amazing deal,5
3337,Just wow!,"The laptop is the best option for someone who is already a mac or iOS user and is one of the best options for someone who isn‚Äôt. The fan less design and apple designed M1 chip just make this machine a beast that devours everyday tasks and easily handle some heavy duty tasks as well.
It serves it‚Äôs purpose and gets out of the way when you‚Äôre done. The instant wake, really fast SSD, best touchpad, excellent speakers and microphones, along with the premium design and the deep integration with r...

3338,Highly recommended,"Great laptop for someone who is a FIRST TIME APPLE user. Connectivity is nice and security is awesome. The ability to MULTITASK is the speciality of this laptop. It doesn't matter if this the base variant. I had no problem running PHOTOSHOP, ADOBE XD, FIGMA, PREMIER RUSH, and FLUTTER as well. This laptop can survive all the heavy open at the same time. So good at handling at these tasks. And when ever i use this for browsing only, the BATTERY LIFE would be beyond compare. I would go on for 4 ...

3339,Best in the market!,I got it for the children and they just love it. More than anything the delivery was on time. The person was dead tierd taking care of all the BBD sales.

So more later...,5
3340,Best in the market!,I love the new M1 MacBook Air 2020! I got the silver one in 256 gb. Absolutely amazing! I got it at a steal and would recommend to buy this at a nice price! Love it!!,5
3341,Fabulous!,"So, this is my first experience with a MacBook. In the past the MacBook Air was considered an underperforming notebook for a very high price. But now because of the m1 chip the performance is incredible for all the apps that can be run on the relatively new platform. Only thing is if you need more RAM or storage, pls upgrade before buying because all parts are soldered into the motherboard so you cannot upgrade it in the future. For me 8gb ram and 256 go ssd is more than enough",5
3342,Mind-blowing purchase,"A beautiful device. Arrived late but perfectly packaged. I've been using it for a week now and it's a pleasure to use. The battery life is phenomenal and the performance is super smooth and speedy. No lag or any issues.

Screen, Sound and microphone quality are awesome.

Battery life also very good.
Overall good laptop",5
3350,Worth every penny,Writing the review after usage of 3 weeks. I'm in awe of this small beast. Performance is too good to be true plus the video and sound quality is just amazing. Worth the money in all terms. Battery backup is also great. Expect 12-13 hours on a single charge with normal usage which is way too higher as compared to any other window laptop. All in all couldn't have asked for.more. The only cons could be that it's not touch screen.,5
3351,Pretty good,"It is my first apple product ,what an awesome experience. I am so happy to get this MacBook AIR m1 .The performance, color contrast I can give 5 star ,especially the portable classy look of this MacBook air silver is so elegant, music clarity and my favorite part is the trackpad gesture .Overall rating I am giving 4 star because of the webcam. I am bit disappointed with the web cam. Didn't expect this bad quality of web cam.",4
3352,Just wow!,"Apple Mac has a class in it's own, simply outstanding!! The Big Billion Days offer makes it an even crazy deal. Great improvement from the last gen Mac, it now gets a crisper screen with less bezels and looks a lot more premium. You must use it to experience it.

Everything else is just perfect, excited to start using it more, Go for it without a second thought!!",5
3353,Highly recommended,"It feels like magic! Be it the speed with which it starts up / wakes from sleep, loads pages on safari, etc etc. Super fast and snappy and ofcourse feels super premium to use, especially the tactile feedback of the touchpad. The keyboard is far better than the previous model.",5

3431,Simply awesome,"After using this laptop for almost 1 month, i am giving this review.

Laptop can run AAA games like Valorant and GTA V without any lag, but settings need to be changed in DRAGON CENTER. Since laptop uses RTX 3060 and 144hz, it will use most of the battery power, so always need to plugged in while playing most games. Just buy a Cooler Pad, if you are playing for too long and so if you expect longer battery, please restrict yourselves.

For long run Intel i7 10th gen is very good, with 16gb RAM...

Good laptop. Light weight. Can play all AAA games .nvme SSD, rtx3060, 16gb ram ,i7 everything is good.

Cons: bad service centre, lack of number pad on side makes it difficult if you work on this, keyboard is terrible it flexes in if you type hard, below average battery backup, rtx 3060 Is limited to 75w tgp in this laptop version . So you will only get a comparable performance to rtx 2060 desktop version. don't expect desktop 3060 level performance I got fooled on this part.

The only con is that build quality is not that good but you can manage. The biggest myth is sound quality which quite loud in this but the 720p camera is very very bad , like bad as my previous laptop which was just 18000 in price .
In a nuty go for it don't think too much beleive me you will proud of your decision.

It boots up lightening fast and ready to use in just 5-8 seconds. Freaking awesome speed! All the games and apps that i have tried ran smoothly as expected and sometimes beyond expectations. The two downsides are its poor webcam ( which we never use) and the battery. The battery runs out very fast while gaming. 1-2 hours. Otherwise for normal use it will stay up for at least 5-7 hours.

If you are using for gaming and office use this is the best option you can get.

60hz panel is good since the fps won't get 100+ in 1650 so 144hz is more or less a marketing gimmick.

Ryzen 5 variant is more powerful than i5 11th gen.

Fully charged battery gave a backup of less than 2 hrs with normal usage. But after I uninstalled the software it started providing a backup of more than 6 hrs after a full charge.

4241,Simply awesome,"Worth to buy at this price range. Now I gone through all the way of my brand new acer aspire 7. Totally worth it when it comes to gaming and day to day works. But the only little bit cons is the battery, However it's better when comes to normal usage apart from gaming . May be 3- 4 hrs for normal activities which is good for Gaming laptop. I've played GTA 5 in it running at max frame rate at 1080p resolution.

Surely go for this if you are student or programmer or a budget gamerüî•",5

1. Display is FHD and it is good.

5. Design is good.
6. Keyboard and touchpad looks professional.
7. Keyboard keys are smooth.
8. MS Office is lifetime free.
9. Battery Life with internet 3-4 hours and without internet 5-6 hours.
10. Fingerprint Sensor Available.

5376,Mind-blowing purchase >>> Just for it,"Bought this laptop a week ago and I can say proudly that this is the best machine to date that I have used for my day-to-day tasks. Here are some pros and cons:

Pros:

5383,Just okay,"No doubt, the laptop is very good. But this 3 star is only for the apple company itself. There is no USB port or card reader port. You will just get 2 type C port and eventually you have to shed extra 6-8k to buy a good quality dock(connector) for this laptop so that you can connect your hard drives, iphone or card reader, etc. Also, even to get a 512GB variant you have to pay a whooping 20k extra.

Update: the product is quit expensive for my liking when we compare it with its rival like Asus, Acer and other competitive brands. Pros includes: Reliable HP branding
Extensive service centers
Feels tuff n sturdy
Paid window MS office
Good battery life
Cons includes:
No backlit keys
No SSD only HDD
Takes 2-3 mins to boot up the screen which is super slow in today's standard!
Screen is not that great ...

Display and sound
The display is bright, the colours are vibrant, and the sunlight legibility is good as well.The phone has 120Hz refresh rate. You can set it to 120Hz or 60Hz . Under the display options there are different options to adjust colours from Natural, Boosted and Saturated. There is also night light that lets you reduce the display and blue light emission, so it does not cause eye strain when you are reading at night....

Battery- I just charge it 100% in the morning and √≠t backup let me use it the entire day. It consumes 70% in a day even after a heavy use.

8335,Simply awesome,Fantastic phone. I loved it. Looks better then the photos in showcase. I will suggest this phone to People who are looking for a good budget phone. But the camera is not that good. The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience. (Better then redmi) It doesn't have any ads.,5

10242,Good,"Pros:
Excellent battery life
Display has punchy and pleasing colours
Not much heating issues
Satisfactory rear cams
Call quality is acceptable most of the time
Cons:I bet it's not a true HD display.
My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.
Spammy notifications.
I doubt the so called KNOX is actually working in it or not.

10330,Really Nice,Good phone... Nice camera... Great battery life .. almost 44 gb of free space is available after pre-installed apps(for 64 gb model),4
10331,Mind-blowing purchase,"Samsung delivered a phone at his best for this price.
Camera is good as per the cost and you can not expect more
SAMOLED very good display
Notifications are up to the current trend
Batter is good since 6000 mah power
I don't want to go for china product so I always go for non-china makers
Go for it!",5
10332,Good,"Pros:
Excellent battery life
Display has punchy and pleasing colours
Not much heating issues
Satisfactory rear cams
Call quality is acceptable most of the time
Cons:I bet it's not a true HD display.
My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.
Spammy notifications.
I doubt the so called KNOX is actually working in it or not.

10336,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast.

Many people have criticized it's display because it's old TFT technology but display is quite good and on par with most of IPS displays.
Main USP of this phone is it's software. Other brands provide a bit better specs at the same price but they lack on UI and software updates. Samsung is better in this case with regular updates.
Samsung pay is really useful and way more faster and convenient to use than any other payment app.
Samsung knox security is huge ...

1. Don't buy 4/64 if you plan on using this device for more than a year or two. (Even casual users)

2. If photography is your priority you'll be disappointed. Camera is below average. Though you can drastically improve the camera by using gcam(Highly recommend installing it). It's a hustle but totally worth it.

The only concern that I found is the vibration.
It vibrates a lot. A single message tone is also not bearable.
Moto should work on this immediately to get this fixed.

Also in black theme if we touch the screen then we see some pixels on the screen which looks bad..it feels like there is some issue in display.

Auto quality is good but can be better. Vibration is seriously taking out all positive aspects of this phone.

1) SOUND: It sounds terrible through stereo speakers, but is best to none in this range when it comes to details via good headphones. It can drive High impedance earphones in a decent way, like KZs. I have seen many phones which require external DAC to support those babies. This one does it in style.

12005,Wonderful,"Nice mobile ...
It's very nice under the 20k budget smart phones with 5G net work... I satisfied with the performance of the mobile in many areas.. but some improvement needs in the screen cast. Whenever I attempt screen cast with my sony tv it's getting connected but after some time it's automatically disconnected, that only made me dissatisfaction. Camera performance seems ok...90 Hz refresh rate is very good. Battery performance and stability is good...",4
12006,Very Good,"Camera Is Good
Poor Battery Back up
Slow Charging
Display is Good
Processer also good
Performance was ok

Battery Performance was the Only problem otherwise it was a okayish one and worth for money",4
12007,Fair,"Phone is good for this price range, performance display is good, Camera is decent.

The only thing I do not like about this device is user interface. Earlier I used Motorola one fusion plus that device user interface is excellent near stock android. If you used stock Android or samsung phones earlier then you might feel realme UI is downgrade.",3
12008,Terrible product,It has a network problem..I had realme 3 and still using it...if I keep both the phone next to each other and call realme 3 has a better network call speak and hear clearly but narzo 30 not even one call you can hear or speak properly now I regret buying it ..it's in Kerala now and I am planning to bring to tamilnadu to see at least it will work here without network issue....,1

12011,Great product,"1st of all it's look very stylish while using with case. I am using the grey one. Before that any phone doesn't look cool with case.
2nd thing is good battery backup, it takes 1 and half hour to get full charge.
3rd, it's touch very cool and soft. So many hidden features makes it next generation.
No need to hesitate before buying it. No need to wait 2 or 3 month for Xiaomi phone. It comes with latest features.",5
12012,Good quality product,"It's is good but somewhere software lagging from Vivo. Software may be good, company need to consider it.",4
12013,Waste of money!,"A budget phone. But there are some cons. When call is coming you will experience lag to attend call usually. Fast charging is not upto mark will take time to get full charge. Camera is average. Wifi does not work properly. I tested with other phone wifi works fine but in this phone you will surely face problems with wifi. Battery is good will give you one day of full usage. Not recommended for gamers as there is a lag in UI of this phone. You can buy only if you are normal user with average p...

I dont play games on this phone and do no such thing that might slow it down.

After 15 Days of Usage:-
-Display is fabulous.
-Battery backup decent. Thanks to 33w fast charger.
-Performance is also more than average.

-Front Camera is good one. No problem at all for Selfies.

Cons:
-Lot of Bloatwares.
- Heating issue even on normal usage. But honestly after 7-10 days of usage now I don't feel heating issue. May be the software optimisation ev...

The overall performance of the gadget is satisfactory",4
13305,Nice,The Redmi smartphone is good but what bad is the after service of flipkart as the don't provide the sufficient assistance from their side regarding the ekart service. If someone got left something valuable they just can't help to recover it.,3

Camera is okay not the best.

13309,Horrible,"The worst phone I ever seen. I think a phone with 1gb RAM performs good than its.
It's running slow. It's hanging so much. When you open the call log, 1st you see a black screen for a moment... After daily a number, the screen goes black for while, comes light and then light goes away.
Reboot taking so much time.
Battery backup not good as expected.

13805,Super!,"Pros: Display , battery is really good in both quick charging as well as back up life.. and performance also good. no lags so far. value for money... less weight.. no heating issue..

Cons:
Camera should be better.. okay type of camera ( try gcam i think it delivers good clarity)

ps: i didnt tried for gaming will update once i did.. also i have to work camera to find out more.. will update soon.",5
13806,Worth every penny,"I'm writing about my experience with this device (6/128). I hope these might help you to make a purchase decision.

1. Don't buy 4/64 if you plan on using this device for more than a year or two. (Even casual users)

2. If photography is your priority you'll be disappointed. Camera is below average. Though you can drastically improve the camera by using gcam(Highly recommend installing it). It's a hustle but totally worth it.

3. The screen is on par with what you expect from an OLED panel. D...

13807,Delightful,"The product is really good for the price being offered.
The only concern that I found is the vibration.
It vibrates a lot. A single message tone is also not bearable.
Moto should work on this immediately to get this fixed.

Also in black theme if we touch the screen then we see some pixels on the screen which looks bad..it feels like there is some issue in display.

Auto quality is good but can be better. Vibration is seriously taking out all positive aspects of this phone.

13810,Value-for-money,"For the price I would say, the phone gives you enough juice out of what it offers. I am a purist. I like good distortion-free sound, color-accurate visuals, and decent camera performance.

1) SOUND: It sounds terrible through stereo speakers, but is best to none in this range when it comes to details via good headphones. It can drive High impedance earphones in a decent way, like KZs. I have seen many phones which require external DAC to support those babies. This one does it in style.

The screen double tap on and off is not available and I'd have loved to get that as it is a function I regularly use. A secure folder function similar to the one provided in Samsung phones would be good too. The camera could also use a bit of improvement.
Other than these, its definitely a phone I would recommend. If...

The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.
Thank You

Like the review if you get helped out.",5

I like this product.",5
15616,Wonderful,"After lot of research, finally decided to go with Boat Smart watch. Got the delivery in 2 days. FlipKart is as usual rocking with speed delivery. I haven't fully checked all the options of the watch but as a first look, watch is good. Light weight. Syncs well eith mobile phone via ProGear App. Able to change the skin via cloud. So far so good. Will check other features and update my review later.",4
15617,Mind-blowing purchase,"Nice smart watch, best purchase, I love it, step count approx right...",5
15618,Don't waste your money,"We used this smart watch in 3 month then we write the review
Battery capacity only 10 days approx
Touch display good
Sensor not work
Screen is good

Not good product.",1
15619,Very poor,Watch wise good but smart watch wise fail i bought for check oxizen level but it fail.,1
15620,Nice product,"If call function is it there this watch is awesome , and even we can't attend call but we can see notification and reject the call , very simplest design and limited app facilities. Heart beat measurements are accurate or not I'm not sure about is steps and other calorie function are normal like other smart watch and battery capacity is depends on usage specified by the product üôÇ",4
15621,Not good,"First of all device should hav at least some battery inside the box.

Pros:
1 Most sensors at this price (at least on paper).
2 Nice build quality especially Strap and dial material.

Cons :
1 Heart rate sensor shows 15-20 beats more than actual (in my case).
2 SPO2 values differs upto 10-15 % every time when checked continuosly.
3 Step count is not as accurate as my MI band 5.
4 OS is not furnished right now.",2
15622,Just wow!,"Good watch during sports activities. Nice design.. Display of step counting is very small for older people. Bp, oxigen count and heart beat are almost accurate... Any way good item.. Battery will last for 6 days",5
15623,Does the job,"Some of functions needs to be upgraded, hoat pro gear app is the only way to operate the functions. It does not support google Wear OS app. Most important, the available dail looks are just ordinary not so cool. Watching time function is not user friendly. Touch is good but dial looks small. Bluetooth range is also a constraint. Can be much better",3

15712,Terrible product,The watch is good but not up to its price . According to me there should me more featured in it as there are many watches in same price with more better features therefore I would not recommend it . You could get a better product in same budget. Only the battery and body of the watch is good but the function are no at all good . Some apps do not even open. There are only 6 apps working all related to health only.. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST,1

15718,Not good,Notifications are biggest issue. You have to do the setting again and again in the app. Even after that notification functionality doesn't work properly. No wonder why it's so cheap. Won't recommended to buy it. As there is no use of the smart watch if you don't get proper notifications.,2

As I said, in my initial usage, the watch holds really good, functionalities working fine!

15721,Just wow!,"After 2 days of research, 100 of reviews and YouTube videos I finally got this with Republic Day offer for 2k. Mostly it is 2.5k. its worth the money.

Oxygen sensor is accurate (checked with actual oxymeter), walking tracker is bang accurate. For price of an Apple watch you can buy Boat watch for your entire apartment.",5

Cons:

The below views are after the updation of the app to the latest version.

But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3
15733,Mind-blowing purchase,"A genuinely review of the boat Strom watch

At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price
It was a very very low weight watch.
The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.

19286,Does the job,"Received today. This is my 2nd smart watch, 1st was GTS 2 Mini, which is a really really good product.

First impressions: Good display, Premium looks, quality strap, sufficient features, lots of watch faces, watch face sync was easy, at times UI lags with slow response, Dizo App needs improvement. I would rate it 3.5 considering the price and built quality.",3
19287,Value-for-money,"Value for money, decent features and battery. Great buy at around 3.5k. Software bugs persists but bearable... worth the money if u r looking for entry level smart watch. One of the best at this price.",4
19288,Awesome,"Genuine Review A/C to my usage
Really Got impressed with the product.
The design and the look is jst awesome‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Love‚ù§Ô∏è this product.
BATTERY Backup is Good, No Issue With that.
If U use this Watch With AOD and all day heart monitoring. it will last around 2 days easily.
If u use all day heart monitoring and all the feature except AOD then it will last around 7-8 days..
On screen torch is not as such problem for me
I think the best smart watch under 4000..
So jst go for it..",5
19289,Super!,This watch offers great value for money. The watch looks absolutely premium and well above the price range it is offered for. The UI and features function seamlessly. The only grey area is the Dizo application which needs to be more polished. Hopefully Dizo continues to offer software support to this watch for atleast 2 years if not more.,5
19290,Perfect product!,Very good product love it recommended for everyone best budget watch,5
19291,Bad quality,"Not worth the price.

It is just a basic fitness band sold at high price.

Good things
- bright display
- perfect size of watch and dial


Bad things
- battery does not charge fully
- heartbeat sensor is not accurate during exercise
- software is very basic",2
19292,Does the job,"At this price the watch seems like a steal deal but actually is not.....

Cons:

-Bezels are as thick as any other watch available in the market

-Transition animation is not smooth, is a bit jittery.

-You can only keep 5 dial faces in the watch out of which only one dial face will be changed via the app.

-Camera func only works within the dizo app

-music func is works 50-50 and doesn't show any information regarding the audio that is playing.

-most of the dial faces aren't pitch black ...

19405,Don't waste your money,The tracking measurements are way off the charts. Reads heart rate of soft fabrics like socks or clothes and even books. Spo2 is fairly reliable. Step counting is too high than actual.,1
19406,Does the job,"Received today. This is my 2nd smart watch, 1st was GTS 2 Mini, which is a really really good product.

First impressions: Good display, Premium looks, quality strap, sufficient features, lots of watch faces, watch face sync was easy, at times UI lags with slow response, Dizo App needs improvement. I would rate it 3.5 considering the price and built quality.",3
19407,Value-for-money,"Value for money, decent features and battery. Great buy at around 3.5k. Software bugs persists but bearable... worth the money if u r looking for entry level smart watch. One of the best at this price.",4
19408,Awesome,"Genuine Review A/C to my usage
Really Got impressed with the product.
The design and the look is jst awesome‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Love‚ù§Ô∏è this product.
BATTERY Backup is Good, No Issue With that.
If U use this Watch With AOD and all day heart monitoring. it will last around 2 days easily.
If u use all day heart monitoring and all the feature except AOD then it will last around 7-8 days..
On screen torch is not as such problem for me
I think the best smart watch under 4000..
So jst go for it..",5
19409,Super!,This watch offers great value for money. The watch looks absolutely premium and well above the price range it is offered for. The UI and features function seamlessly. The only grey area is the Dizo application which needs to be more polished. Hopefully Dizo continues to offer software support to this watch for atleast 2 years if not more.,5
19410,Perfect product!,Very good product love it recommended for everyone best budget watch,5
19411,Bad quality,"Not worth the price.

It is just a basic fitness band sold at high price.

Good things
- bright display
- perfect size of watch and dial


Bad things
- battery does not charge fully
- heartbeat sensor is not accurate during exercise
- software is very basic",2
19412,Does the job,"At this price the watch seems like a steal deal but actually is not.....

Cons:

-Bezels are as thick as any other watch available in the market

-Transition animation is not smooth, is a bit jittery.

-You can only keep 5 dial faces in the watch out of which only one dial face will be changed via the app.

-Camera func only works within the dizo app

-music func is works 50-50 and doesn't show any information regarding the audio that is playing.

-most of the dial faces aren't pitch black ...

Battery life is great, its been on 100% for last 7 hours with moderate usage. Plenty of watch faces available. App is decent, sometimes takes time to load all watch faces but not a dealbreaker.

19566,Does the job,"Received today. This is my 2nd smart watch, 1st was GTS 2 Mini, which is a really really good product.

Really Got impressed with the product.

BATTERY Backup is Good, No Issue With that.
If U use this Watch With AOD and all day heart monitoring. it will last around 2 days easily.
If u use all day heart monitoring and all the feature except AOD then it will last around 7-8 days..
On screen torch is not as such problem for me
I think the best smart watch under 4000..
So jst go for it..",5
19569,Super!,This watch offers great value for money. The watch looks absolutely premium and well above the price range it is offered for. The UI and features function seamlessly. The only grey area is the Dizo application which needs to be more polished. Hopefully Dizo continues to offer software support to this watch for atleast 2 years if not more.,5

19571,Bad quality,"Not worth the price.

Bad things

Cons:

-Bezels are as thick as any other watch available in the market

-Transition animation is not smooth, is a bit jittery.

-You can only keep 5 dial faces in the watch out of which only one dial face will be changed via the app.

-Camera func only works within the dizo app

-music func is works 50-50 and doesn't show any information regarding the audio that is playing.

-most of the dial faces aren't pitch black ...

If U use this Watch With AOD and all day heart monitoring. it will last around 2 days easily.

On screen torch is not as such problem for me
I think the best smart watch under 4000..
So jst go for it..",5
19689,Super!,This watch offers great value for money. The watch looks absolutely premium and well above the price range it is offered for. The UI and features function seamlessly.

If U use this Watch With AOD and all day heart monitoring. it will last around 2 days easily.

On screen torch is not as such problem for me
I think the best smart watch under 4000..
So jst go for it..",5
19809,Super!,This watch offers great value for money. The watch looks absolutely premium and well above the price range it is offered for. The UI and features function seamlessly.

-You can only keep 5 dial faces in the watch out of which only one dial face will be changed via the app.

-Camera func only works within the dizo app

22049,Value-for-money,"Im writing this review after a usage of 20 days... So, it may vary with time.

The best is the battery backup, it will not say that it will last for what it is said, but it still performs better than others in the market.

Other features like oximeter, heart monitor are very helpful in this covid time... They are not the exact but still very much approximate.

Rest will see what it has to offer for me in the future updates ü§û",4

Pros:
-Extremely light weight watch.
-Dial Quality is also v good.
-Battery is superb.
-UI is very smooth.
-Vibration strength is too good ( i really like that in).
-Sensors are not 100% accurate but they do not collect the data from table etc which is good.

Cons:

23352,Great product,"After using it for 1 month, here is my review:

1. After charging realme Watch S to 100% it will be at 100% for 3-4 consecutive days (based on my usage).

There are some minor bugs which must be fixed in update like.
